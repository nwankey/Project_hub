This is a web scraping project that focused on crime news headlines from the washington post. It was a challenging project because the source website had a unique "Load More" 
buttn that took a lot of work to automate before headlines could be extracted.

Also in this repository is a function that returns a keyword search from a list of headlines.

finally, it includes an exploratory data analysis of complaints received by the NYPD in the year 2022. 

ENJOY!!
